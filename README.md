# CRINGE, ABANDONED
# SansTale

An Undertale Fangame written in Love2D.
I am aware of the existence of another Sanstale fangame ([play it here](https://sanstale.netlify.app/)), 
but it contains only the final Genocide boss fight. 
This project, however, will contain not only Genocide, 
and not only the battle screen.

Love2D can be downloaded for free at the [official website](https://love2d.org).

The game requires at least version 11.3 of Love2D to run properly.

## What's the point?

This is a fangame that is Undertale, but from Sans' perspective.
**However!** It isn't just a re-skin,
because of the following plans (mark them as done when time comes):
+ Sans is *far* from a silent protagonist,
he will comment on stuff when you check them,
and maybe break the 4th wall occasionally
+ The story is experienced very differently from canon Undertale
STATUS: the story is in early development, and **I'll be glad if anyone contributes ideas**
+ Game mechanics, such as teleporting, attack mechanics

(Feel free to fork this and/or contribute)

## How to Install

Download and unzip the .zip archive in the "Clone or download" menu,
instructions below.

## Running it
### Linux / Mac

On Linux-based OSes (including Mac), it should be possible to just install
Love2D from the distributive of the OS, like so (do this in a terminal):
```
sudo apt-get install love
```
If you can't find Love2D in the distributive, do those commands before
the one above:
```
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:bartbes/love-stable
sudo apt-get update
```
After that, if Love2D installed successfully, go into Sanstale's folder
and run:
```
love .
```

### Windows

Download the Love2D .zip file from the official website, and unzip it.
Next you should drag the game directory (the whole thing not the contents!)
into `love.exe` (not `lovec.exe`!).

### How to know it works

After doing the steps for your OS the game window should open.

The title of the window should be "sanstale" (lowercase), if it is something
like "LÃ–VE 11.*?* (*love version name*)", that means that the engine started
without the game supplied to it.

Open an issue with *"help wanted"* label if something did not work.
